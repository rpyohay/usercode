This package contains scripts and macros necessary for making the gamma-gamma, fake-fake, e-gamma, e-e, and e-track samples.  To get the code, do:

cvs co UserCode/yohay/GMSBAnalysis

which will check out the HEAD.  The source code is in:

EventSelector.h
EventSelector.cc
analysis.C
format.h

An example macro is:

analysis_macro.C

In the function call to runSampleMaker in analysis_macro.C, you will see that the third argument is the name of a configuration file.  This file specifies all the cuts for the sample you would like to create.  An example configuration file is:

sample_cfg.txt

See format.h for definitions of HLT bits.  Once a macro and configuration file have been specified, run the analysis with

root -l -q analysis_macro.C

The output file will contain histograms of e/gamma quantities (isolation, H/E, sigmaIetaIeta, etc.) and track quantities (for the e-track sample), as well as the full event tree for all events passing the selection.

To automate the creation of analysis macros, use makeAnalysisMacro.sh, configured with analysis_macro_cfg.txt.  To run it, call

./makeAnalysisMacro.sh analysis_macro_cfg.txt

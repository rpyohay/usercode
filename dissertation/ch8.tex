%signal uncertainties, scale factor stuff, MC parameters 
%repeat the table in the section about upper limits, this time including the acceptance errors
%%check effect of JES uncertainty on di-EM pT weights?
%The effect of jet energy scale uncertainty on the final background estimate, through binning of events by number of jets, is taken as 2\%.  This figure comes from an earlier version of this analysis based on 35 $\mbox{pb}^{-1}$ of LHC data \cite{CMS_GMSB_35pb-1}.  \textcolor{red}{\textbf{This figure comes from a totally different study.  We have not checked how JES uncertainties affect the di-EM $p_{T}$ weights.  Should we?}}
